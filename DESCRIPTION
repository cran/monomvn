Description: Estimation of multivariate normal (MVN) and student-t data of 
 arbitrary dimension where the pattern of missing data is monotone.
 See Pantaleo and Gramacy (2010) <arXiv:0907.2135>.
 Through the use of parsimonious/shrinkage regressions 
 (plsr, pcr, lasso, ridge,  etc.), where standard regressions fail, 
 the package can handle a nearly arbitrary amount of missing data. 
 The current version supports maximum likelihood inference and 
 a full Bayesian approach employing scale-mixtures for Gibbs sampling.
 Monotone data augmentation extends this Bayesian approach to arbitrary 
 missingness patterns.  A fully functional standalone interface to the 
 Bayesian lasso (from Park & Casella), Normal-Gamma (from Griffin & Brown),
 Horseshoe (from Carvalho, Polson, & Scott), and ridge regression 
 with model selection via Reversible Jump, and student-t errors 
 (from Geweke) is also provided.
